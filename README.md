# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Birthday-Celebrities
This project is based on Dynamic webscraping using Python.
It scrap the name,image,profession,best work from the website - https://www.imdb.com/ and using that data scrap the comment section of that particular celebrities from twitter and match the comment with the contents of files named as negative.txt and positive.txt which is already given.If his/her positive nature is more than negative then print positive else negative, if both are equal then neutral.Along with nature it prints name, image ,profession , best work also. 
made few changes.
